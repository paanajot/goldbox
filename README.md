This is just my personal repository where I keep everything I code in my spare time (since May 2022). You will find many things related to c++, python3, docker, computer vision and more.

Worth checking out:
- **set_finder** - a computer vision application
- **cpp/lib/src/graph** - a compile-time graph implementation
- **cpp/lib/src/metaprogramming** - place where I practice templates
- **cpp/practice/tests/testing** - shows how to write mock test via linker (in case you cannot use the dependency injection pattern)

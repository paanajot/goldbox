############# Create, start, run #############
# Create, start and run all sound pretty similar but they each have their own distinct roles.

Create adds a writeable container on top of your image and sets it up for running whatever
command you specified in your CMD. The container ID is reported back but itâ€™s not started.

Start will start any stopped containers. This includes freshly created containers.

Run is a combination of create and start. It creates the container and starts it.

# Example
docker container run -it [docker_image] /bin/bash

How to write a Website Welcome Message
On your homepage, you need to make it obvious to your visitors:-

What your website offers them
What they can find and achieve on your website
You can achieve this in a number of ways:-

If it is not immediately obvious to your visitors what your website is about, you are going to need to write a welcome message which makes the purpose of your website clear.
If your website is simple, it may not be necessary to write a welcome message.  You may be able to display some sample previews of your content which, in combination with your menu, will make it obvious to your visitors what they can find on your website.
The modern trend is towards the second option – with no formal welcome message or statement of purpose. However, when a site is complex, it becomes essential to explain to your users, in as few simple words as possible, what they can find on your site and how they can get started.

The key to writing a good welcome message is to make it focused on your users’ wants and needs, and make it extremely simple.
